# Music Streaming KPI & Performance Analysis (Spotify Case Study)

**Engineering KPIs and analyzing user engagement to evaluate performance patterns in a freemium music streaming model**  
*A Google Sheets–based data model combined with Tableau dashboards to derive insights across user activity, monetization, and retention KPIs.*

---

## Overview

The project addressed the needs of **three key stakeholders** at Spotify:  

- **Sarah (Head of Strategy)** – focused on long-term growth and user trends  
- **Mark (Director of Revenue)** – optimizing revenue streams and ARPU  
- **Olivia (VP of Operations)** – ensuring cost efficiency and operational effectiveness

The goal was to clean and enrich Spotify’s financial and user engagement dataset, engineer additional KPIs, and develop stakeholder-focused dashboards in Tableau.

## Project Objectives

- Provide a comprehensive analysis of Spotify’s revenue, costs, and user base  
- Deliver actionable insights to improve profitability, engagement, and efficiency  
- Build **interactive dashboards** tailored to each stakeholder’s perspective  
- Document KPI calculations and design assumptions for transparency  

---

## Dataset

The dataset (Q1/2017 – Q1/2023) contained Spotify’s financial and engagement metrics.  
Key fields included:  

- **Revenue & Profitability:** Total Revenue, Premium Revenue, Ad Revenue, Gross Profit, Net Profit  
- **User Metrics:** MAUs, Premium MAUs, Ad MAUs, ARPU (Premium & Ad)  
- **Cost Structure:** Cost of Revenue, Sales & Marketing, R&D, General & Administrative  
- **Derived KPIs (engineered):**  
  - ARPU (Ad & Premium)  
  - CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) for Ad and Premium  
  - LTV (Lifetime Value) & LTV/CAC Ratio  
  - Profitability Ratios (Gross Profit %, CIR, etc.)  

---

## Approach

1. **Data Review & Cleaning**  
   - Corrected inconsistencies in Google Sheets (e.g., revenue, cost, profit figures)  
   - Added missing metrics like **Net Profit**  
   - Created a clean, enriched dataset for analysis  

2. **Feature Engineering / KPI Development**  
   - Researched KPI logic for freemium business models (churn rate, LTV, CAC)  
   - Implemented formulas for ARPU, LTV, CAC, LTV/CAC Ratio  
   - Validated results against existing benchmarks  

3. **Scope of Work & Design Plan (Phase 1)**
   - Defined stakeholder questions and KPIs  
   - Mapped deliverables and milestones (Dashboard, Report, Recording)  

4. **Dashboard Design (Phase 2)**
   - **Overview Dashboard** – High-level KPIs for Strategy (Sarah)  
   - **User Details Dashboard** – Detailed ARPU, MAU, LTV/CAC for Revenue (Mark)  
   - **Cost Structure Dashboard** – Cost breakdown and efficiency analysis for Operations (Olivia)  
   - **Key Insights & Recommendations** – Strategic takeaways per stakeholder  
   - **Annotations Page** – Documented formulas and KPI assumptions  

---

## Deliverables

- **Cleaned Dataset** (Google Sheets)  
- **Scope of Work & Design Plan** (PDF)  
- **Final Report** (PDF with insights & recommendations)  
- **Tableau Dashboards** (Overview, User Details, Cost Structure, Key Insights, Recommendations, Annotations)  
- **Recorded Presentation** (project summary & walkthrough)  

---

## Key Insights

- **Revenue & Profitability**: Premium accounts drive revenue growth, but profitability is still negative due to low ad monetization and high CAC.  
- **User Growth**: MAUs are growing, but the share of paying Premium users is decreasing → pressure on ARPU.  
- **Ad-Supported Users**: Very low ARPU, generating losses. Opportunity lies in better ad monetization and Free-to-Premium conversion.  
- **Cost Structure**: Over 60% of costs are tied to Premium delivery. R&D and Marketing costs are rising → efficiency potential identified.  

---

## Recommended Actions

**Sarah (Strategy)**  

- Focus on sustainable Premium growth  
- Monitor Ad vs. Premium MAU ratio as early signal  

**Mark (Revenue)**  

- Improve ARPU through pricing and upsell strategies  
- Strengthen ad monetization (targeted formats, brand partnerships)  
- Systematically drive Free-to-Premium conversions  

**Olivia (Operations)**  

- Streamline Premium delivery costs  
- Analyze R&D and Sales & Marketing spend for efficiency  
- Use **LTV/CAC Ratio** as a core KPI for efficiency management  

---

## Results

- A fully functional **Spotify-branded Tableau dashboard** serving stakeholder needs  
- Clear documentation of **KPIs and assumptions**  
- Actionable recommendations for growth, profitability, and efficiency  
- Professional end-to-end workflow: **data cleaning → KPI engineering → dashboard → reporting**
